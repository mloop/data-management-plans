# I see three main benefits of a data management plan

1. It makes you evaluate tradeoffs beforehand
2. It helps prepare you for an audit
3. It helps you make a scope of work, a budget, and allocate personnel.

# There are many components to a quality data management plan, some of which you may not have thought of.

---

* Study description and milestones (with timeline)
* Responsibilities (names) and scope of work
* Study configuration: sites, users, visit / form schedule
* Computer systems to be used: hardware *and* software; includes data management system
* Data sources, data flow diagram

---

* Form and data entry screen design
* Data capture
* External data sources: data transfer agreements, data dictionaries, frequency of transfers
* Data validation: checks / unit tests, data discrepancy (query) tracking and flow

---

* Site monitoring plan
* Other systems: randomization, drug tracking, specimen tracking, imaging, serious adverse events (SAEs)
* Reporting
* Extracted data files
* Study closeout
* Data security

# Data management plans have many benefits

* Forces planning  
* You can document adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  
* Ensure usability, preservation, and access to data later on  
* Standardization across sites
